Excellent question — and it’s one every smart developer asks when setting up a Next.js app with parallel routes or layouts. Let’s break this down 👇

🧠 Why You might see (marketing) and (dashboard) folders

These named route groups — (marketing) and (dashboard) — are part of a recommended Next.js architecture pattern for apps that have both public and private sections.

Here’s the idea:

Folder	Purpose	Example URLs	Access
(marketing)	Public pages (home, about, contact)	/, /about, /contact	Everyone
(dashboard)	Authenticated user pages (profile, analytics, settings)	/dashboard, /dashboard/settings	Logged-in users only

✅ They are “groups”, not actual routes — the parentheses tell Next.js not to include that name in the URL.
So /src/app/(marketing)/page.js → /
And /src/app/(dashboard)/page.js → /dashboard
